## Example of auth page
! Code is not working, just only for reading<br>
All paths are invalid, I didnt provide config with aliases<br>
Can show working example locally if it needed.

#### Stack: React, Typescript, Mobx, Styled-components

### Structure:
- `AuthPage` - entry point of single page for Authorization<br>
- `helpers` - folder with all helper function for global project structure<br>
- `ui` - folder with some elements of UI design system
- `widgets` - folder with main Auth widget with all configurations and additional widgets for authorization process
